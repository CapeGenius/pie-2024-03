                <h2>Electrical System</h2>
                <p> The electrical system of our reaction control system consists of 4 main elements: A microcontroller, 
                    an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), 4 relay modules, and 4 solenoid valves.
                    For our microcontroller, we opted to use an ESP32 Development Board. From its 3.3V output, we power our IMU
                    and relays. Based on the IMU data, the firmware on the ESP32 sends a signal to the relays indicating them to close.
                    From there, the 'common' pin of the relays is tied to 12V and the solenoid valve is the load. 
                </p>

                <h3>Challenges</h2>
                <p>
                    We encountered several challenges during the implementation of our electrical system. One of which was that our IMU 
                    was resetting at seemingly random times. We determined by probing its power pins with an oscilliscope that this was due to 
                    interference on the power line. This makes sense, especially considering our usage of solenoid valves, which are big inductors
                    that can cause EMI and back EMF. To solve this problem, our first step was to add flyback diodes across the solenoid valves to prevent
                    unwanted voltage spikes when the current suddenly changes. While this definitley a necessary addition, it did not totally resolve our problems.
                    
                    Next, we added a small inductor across the common ground of the 3.3V supply and the 12V supply to filter out any potential offset. We additionally
                    added a 100 uF capacitor in parallel with the IMU's power and ground to absorb or compensate for any sudden voltage changes. This solved our problem. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Another challenge we encountered was that when we had pressurized air in our tanks, the solenoid valves would not all open. Initially we thought that 
                    this must have been a blockage in the tubing, however what tipped us off that this was a power issue was that when the pressure in the tanks was lowered,
                    both valves would function and allow air to flow. So, we determined that at higher pressures, the valves needed a higher current supplied in order to open.
                    In retrospect, this was a simple issue to fix, all we had to do was raise the current limit on our power supply. However, it was tough to diagnose since we 
                    were not even sure which system was causing problems!</p>
